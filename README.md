# EC503-Project-Bagging-with-KNN-DT
This is our group project, Bagging with KNN &amp; DT.

Group member: Tianshi Zhang, Haocheng Zhang, Taozhan Zhang, Zhengyi Cao, Yi Xiang (Boston University, ECE students) 

Our project use some functions from prtools library. So before using please download that library and make sure add it to path.

TREE and KNN are the code how we build those two method. 

baggingError is how we calculate error of bagging.

baggingTrain is how we train our model.

baggingPrediction is how we predict our model in validation subsets.

Testbags is comparing how the number of bags affect validation error.

TestnbFolds is comparing how the number of elements per bag affect validation error.

TestRatio is comparing how we split our samples into training subset and validation subset.

There are some dataset in the dataset.zip file.

Figures.zip contains our results.
